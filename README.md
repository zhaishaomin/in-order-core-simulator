# in-order-core-simulator
Just for study personnally ; 
based on labs of CMU 18-447;
typical five stages MIPS pipeline with branch predictor 
step1:add branch predictor and caches into the origin model;
      branch predictor include btb , ras and pht. 
step2:build a scalable interconnect model;
step3:put many cores together to build a multicore systemÔºÅ
